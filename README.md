MRTD Scanning and Validation by implementing LUHN algorithm:

Our project uses LUHN algorithm, an algorithm usually used for Credit Card Fraud Detections by calculating the checksum; to calculate the checksum of various passport fields and verify its validity. 

Overview: 
The repository is consisting of multiple files. The individual python files are just the code files which have multiple functions developed throughout the time. These sigular fuction files were committed as an individual part of the project delivery on stipulated time. 
The MRTDAPP file is the one where the whole code is consolidated as a whole. To clone, MRTDAPP file should be the best one in order to get the whole code and all the test cases associated to it. 

Data Dependancy : For the validation purpose we use records_encoded and records_decoded files which are also in the folder of MRTDAPP
